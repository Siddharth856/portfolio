    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! Iâ€™m Siddharth Tiwari, a passionate Software Developer and recent graduate in Computer Engineering from Watumal Institute, Mumbai University. With a strong foundation in Node.js, MongoDB, and AWS, I thrive on solving complex problems and building impactful applications.

        Throughout my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, including a Real Estate Property Management System and a Bus Navigation System for Visually Impaired. These experiences have honed my skills in full-stack development, backend architecture, and cloud computing.
        
        I believe in continuous learning and am always eager to expand my knowledge and expertise. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that make a difference in people's lives. Outside of coding, I am passionate about sports, particularly volleyball, cricket, and table tennis.
        
        Feel free to connect with me to discuss potential collaborations or just to chat about technology and software development!
